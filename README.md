<h4 align="center">A wordpress plugin that clears huge fields of <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" target="_blank">WP Rest API</a>.</h4>

## Overview

If you ever used WP Rest API, you should have noticed that there are lots of fields that even your client does not need. It makes no sense to load all fields for simple list or even single post view.

This plugin aims to remove redundant fields on Rest API. For now, it's only available for posts and users.

## Features

There are two endpoints: `compact` and `detailed`. 

Compact is useful for listing posts/users/ and Detailed is better for single post/user view.

Here is what `compact` endpoint looks like for example posts:

```json
[
	{
		"id": 1178,
		"title": "Markup: HTML Tags and Formatting",
		"link": "http://localhost/wordpress/2013/01/11/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/",
		"date": "2013-01-11T20:22:19",
		"image": null
	},
	{
		"id": 1177,
		"title": "Markup: Image Alignment",
		"link": "http://localhost/wordpress/2013/01/10/markup-image-alignment/",
		"date": "2013-01-11T20:22:19",
		"image": "http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/soworthloving-wallpaper.jpg"
	},
	{
		"id": 1176,
		"title": "Markup: Text Alignment",
		"link": "http://localhost/wordpress/2013/01/09/markup-text-alignment/",
		"date": "2013-01-11T20:22:19",
		"image": null
	}
]
``` 


Here is `detailed` endpoint:

```json
[
	{
		"id": 1178,
		"title": "Markup: HTML Tags and Formatting",
		"link": "http://localhost/wordpress/2013/01/11/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/",
		"author": 2,
		"image": null,
		"content": "<h2>Headings</h2>\n<h1>Header one</h1>\n<h2>Header two</h2>\n<h3>Header three</h3>\n<h4>Header four</h4>\n<h5>Header five</h5>\n<h6>Header six</h6>\n<h2>Blockquotes</h2>\n<p>Single line blockquote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stay hungry.

But that&#8217;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we haven&#8217;t done as the things I have done.

		"date": "2013-01-11T20:22:19",
		"categories": [

		]
	},
	{
		"id": 1177,
		"title": "Markup: Image Alignment",
		"link": "http://localhost/wordpress/2013/01/10/markup-image-alignment/",
		"author": 2,
		"image": "http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/soworthloving-wallpaper.jpg",
		"content": "<p>Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter\" title=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" src=\"http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"size-full wp-image-904 alignleft\" title=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" src=\"http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150&#215;150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.",

	}
]
``` 

So here is `compact` endpoint looks like for example users:

```json
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "Example User",
		"image": "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce98d9ae462f57b6427e3c8abad827?s=96&d=mm&r=g"
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Another Example User",
		"image": "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f673b94785fd6f49c62202aff96b5?s=96&d=mm&r=g"
	}
]
``` 

And here is `detailed` endpoint looks like for example users:
```json
[
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Murat Karayalçın",
		"desc": "",
		"image": "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce98d9ae4bc62f57b6427e3c8abad827?s=96&d=mm&r=g",
		"link": "http://localhost/politikyol/author/mkarayalcin/"
	},
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "Oğulcan Orhan",
		"desc": "",
		"image": "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f673b9475f85fd6f49c62202aff96b5?s=96&d=mm&r=g",
		"link": "http://localhost/politikyol/author/root/"
	}
]
```
